-- What: A materialized view (sentiment_agg_15m) that joins sentiments with news_items, unnests tickers, and precomputes 15-minute aggregates per
-- ticker (avg score, counts).

-- Why: Continuous aggregates require a hypertable source; since we didnâ€™t hypertable news_items, we use a materialized view to get the same fast
-- time-series queries today.

-- Long-run value: Your dashboard and signals engine can query a compact, indexed time series instead of re-aggregating raw rows.

-- How it relates: The API reads from this view to serve /sentiment/series.

-- Unique guard (optional) to prevent multiple sentiments per news id.
